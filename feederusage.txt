for feeder:

    nohup sudo python3 controller.py &

note: if the job stops, run:

    sudo python3 controller.py

then enter password, then end, and then try again

and to quit:

    ps -ef | grep python
    sudo kill -9 PID

note: there is a script somewhere on the pi that restarts the controller
whenever there is a power outage. it is not reliable, the version it runs
is likely to break. when possible, restart or run the controller manually.
the restart script is only meant as a backup if nobody is home to restart
the pi properly.

to see this restart script:

    sudo vi /etc/rc.local
